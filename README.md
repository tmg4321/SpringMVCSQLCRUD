##ReadMe for CRUD Income Properties project

This project was conceived, designed and executed by Miles Grandin

This project aims to frame-out the beginnings of site that will accumulate, organize and persist data relevant to targeting high-end, short and medium-term rental properties

This project employs Java, Spring and Gradle technologies

To add, for each property: a picture feature, a note feature

Issues: 
	CSS styling needs to be better organized; 
	Command-object-creation of a Property object worked at first and then didn't after changing the parameters that the Property constructor took - had to @RequestParam after the change - need to understand why;
	Spent significant time finding the correct location in the file hierarchy for files accessed by the application (i.e. CSS files)
